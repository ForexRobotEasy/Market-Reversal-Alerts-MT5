## Code Overview

The code consists of several functions and global variables that work together to identify potential reversal points and display alert rectangles on the chart.

### Global Variables

- `alertTriggered` - A boolean flag that indicates if an alert has been triggered.

### Custom Indicator Functions

- `OnInit()` - This function is called when the indicator is initialized. It allocates indicator buffers and sets up the indicator properties.

- `OnDeinit(const int reason)` - This function is called when the indicator is deinitialized. It allows for cleaning up of resources if necessary.

- `OnCalculate(const int rates_total, const int prev_calculated, const datetime &time[], const double &open[], const double &high[], const double &low[], const double &close[], const long &tick_volume[], const long &volume[], const int &spread[])` - This is the main calculation function of the indicator. It calculates the short-term market structure, checks for potential reversal points, draws alert rectangles, triggers alerts, trails the alert rectangles, and performs other trading functions.

### Supporting Functions

- `IsReversalPoint()` - This function checks if the current point is a potential reversal point based on a specific logic.

- `DrawAlertRectangle()` - This function draws an alert rectangle at the potential reversal point.

- `TrailAlertRectangles()` - This function trails the alert rectangles behind the price.

### Main Program Start Function

- `OnStart()` - This function is called when the indicator is started. It sets up the indicator properties, runs the indicator calculation, and passes the necessary parameters.
